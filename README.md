This Project was done in High School, as I was working as an intern at UCLA's Henry Samueli School of Engineering,
in the Graduate Computer Science Department. I worked under Professor Lixia Zhang as a part of the Internet Research
Lab. This code was written by me to host a MongoDB database that could communicate with a webpage using NDN Interest
and Data packets.
